##Running instructions

When executing the code the user will be asked for a number,
this number is the situation choice, so number 1 executes situation 1,
number 2 executes situation 2, number 3 executes situation 3  and
when number 0 is pressed the program finishes. The situations
contain an option to execute again, adding the deliveries that were not
delivered to the deliveries to deliver if, and only if, there are any.

When any situation executes it reads the files on the Input folder
called carrinhas.txt for the couriers information and the encomendas.txt 
for the deliveries information, therefore changing this files before 
executing a situation makes possible altering information during runtime 
(leaving the file open is not recommended, remember to open the file, do 
the changes, save and close before executing!).
